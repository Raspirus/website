        Welcome to Raspirus, your lightweight signature-based malware scanner. 
        Originally designed to scan attached USB drives using a Raspberry Pi, 
        Raspirus has evolved into a versatile tool capable of scanning local files and folders as well.
        It started out as a Matura project by Benji377 in 2022 Italy and has since been developed further.
