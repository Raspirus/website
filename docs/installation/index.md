# Installation

Raspirus is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it perfect for
devices like the Raspberry Pi. However, since it's written in Rust, it supports
cross-platform installation.

Choose your platform to get started:

- [Desktop](desktop.md)
- [Raspberry Pi](raspberry-pi.md)
- [Mobile Devices](mobile-devices.md) (COMING SOON)
