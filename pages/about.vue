      Hi, I'm Benji377, the maintainer of Raspirus. 
      I started this project in September 2021 as a high school project. Its original purpose was to be used on Raspberry Pi's to
      scan USB sticks for viruses before putting them in your computer. After the school was over, I decided to continue the project
      and make it available for everyone. I have come a long way since then and I am very proud of what I have achieved so far. It
      is now cross-platform and available in 3 languages, furthermore it got faster and more stable. It also allows for more
      customization. I hope you enjoy using Raspirus as much as I enjoy developing it.
